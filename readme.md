# @futuretense/herumi-bls

A Javascript implementation of BLS signatures using the BN-254 curve of Herumi/BLS.

This repository sits as a layer on top a stripped down version of Apache Software Foundation's
`milagro-crypto-js` project, making it compatible with the specifics of MITSUNARI Shigeo's
`herumi/bls` implementation.
